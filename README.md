# sv-cv
sv-cv is an online Swedish-Chuvash Dictionary. There is a huge Chuvash dictionary online: [samah.chv.su](http://samah.chv.su/) that has digitized about 10 paper dictionaries - mostly as Chuvash-Russian. The pair Swedish and Chuvash is of a particular interest for me. I am comfortable with Swedish that makes it easier to translate more precise (compared to English). Swedish is a germanic language and can be absolutely used for further machine translation to English, German etc. Russian is very different from Chuvash. Translating from Chuvash to English to Russian has more losses rather than translating through Swedish.
